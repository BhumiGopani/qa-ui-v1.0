##Things that can be done in better way:
- Set up of POM design pattern
- Integrate testng.xml with Jenkins or any other CICD tools
- I have conisidered only sanity scenarios, we can enhance it more by adding regression suite.
- API's running at the background must also be tested by Rest Assured.
- DB verification
- Test Reporting in more attractive way, like displaying it in Microsoft Allure report or Dashboard
- More unit testing is required
